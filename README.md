> 🎉 **First beta release is live — [`v0.1.0-beta.1`](https://github.com/Cawlumm/lyftr/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.1).** Workouts, programs, gym mode, dashboard, weight, and the new nutrition tracker are all in. Pin this tag for a stable self-host target instead of tracking `main`.

> **Beta** — actively being built. Expect rough edges and frequent updates. Issues and feedback are welcome. The software equivalent of going to the gym for the first time.

> 🌐 **[Live demo → lyftr-demo.fly.dev](https://lyftr-demo.fly.dev)** — log in with `demo@lyftr.local` / `password123`. Shared instance, resets every hour.

## Runs on

Tested and working on:

- **Raspberry Pi 4** (2 GB RAM, arm64 Docker image)
- **Any x86 VPS** — Hetzner CAX11, DigitalOcean Droplet, Oracle Free Tier
- **Synology NAS** via Docker (Container Manager)
- **Proxmox LXC** with Docker installed
- **Local machine** — Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL2)

Single SQLite file, minimal RAM, no external services required.

## Why Lyftr?

**Hevy and Strong** are polished apps but cloud-only, increasingly paywalled, and your data lives on someone else's server. **Wger** is a solid self-hosted option with a lot of features — Lyftr's focus is a more modern, mobile-first UI and a simpler deployment story. **FitNotes** is local-only with no sync or server deployment story.

Lyftr is for people who want a modern, mobile-first workout tracker that they fully own and can run on a $5 VPS or a Raspberry Pi in the corner. No subscription. No vendor lock-in. No "your export is a Pro feature."

## Live Demo

**[lyftr-demo.fly.dev](https://lyftr-demo.fly.dev)**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `demo@lyftr.local` |
| Password | `password123` |

Pre-loaded with 8 weeks of PPL workouts, 90 days of weight logs, and food logs so every page has data to explore. Shared instance — resets automatically every hour so any changes are wiped clean.

Or **register your own account** on the demo — your data persists until the next hourly reset, and nobody else can see it.

---

## Quick Start

> No clone. No build. No Go install required. Just Docker.

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cawlumm/lyftr/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cawlumm/lyftr/main/.env.example
```

Edit `.env` and set a strong `JWT_SECRET` (32+ characters), then:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost` in your browser and create your account. If running on a VPS, replace `localhost` with your server IP or domain.

## Configuration

All variables live in `.env` at the project root.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | *required* | Min 32-char secret for signing tokens |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost` | Comma-separated allow-list of client origins. Use `*` to allow any (the API is Bearer-token based, no cookies) |
| `PORT` | `80` | Host port for the web interface |
| `BACKEND_ORIGIN` | `backend:3000` | Docker **service name**:port the frontend proxies `/api` to — not a host IP. Only change the port, to match a custom backend `PORT` |

> **Self-hosting note:** `BACKEND_ORIGIN` is resolved over the internal Docker network, so it must use the backend's **service name** (`backend`), not your server's host or LAN IP. The default compose only *exposes* the backend on the Docker network — it isn't published to the host — so pointing `BACKEND_ORIGIN` at something like `192.168.1.10:3000` produces a `502 Bad Gateway` (`connect() failed (111: Connection refused)`). If you set a custom backend `PORT`, change only the port (e.g. `backend:3008`).

## Exercise Library

On first startup, Lyftr automatically seeds 800+ exercises from [free-exercise-db](https://github.com/yuhonas/free-exercise-db) in the background. No API key. No setup required. It just works.

```
[startup] exercises table empty — fetching from free-exercise-db...
[startup] seed: synced 868 exercises
```

The seed runs async so the server is immediately available. Exercises appear in the UI within a few seconds.

**Re-sync exercises:** Go to **Settings → Exercise Library** — shows current exercise count and a progress indicator while seeding. Hit **Re-sync** to pull the latest exercises (safe upsert, existing workout data is untouched).

---

## Data & Backups

All workout data is stored in `./data/lyftr.db` (SQLite). Back this up regularly. It's one file. You have no excuse.

```bash
# Backup
cp ./data/lyftr.db ./data/lyftr.db.backup

# Update to latest
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

---

## Running on a VPS

> Because paying $15/month for a fitness app subscription is money better spent on protein powder.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin

mkdir lyftr && cd lyftr
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cawlumm/lyftr/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cawlumm/lyftr/main/.env.example
nano .env   # set JWT_SECRET and CORS_ORIGIN

docker compose up -d
```

For HTTPS, put Lyftr behind Caddy or nginx with a Let's Encrypt certificate.
